## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/44) [`87d76e1`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/87d76e131a85a1419f0ebc05abb400e396c1fc5a) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - Add `bunny db link` and lifecycle integration for `.bunny/database.json`

  - New `bunny db link [database-id]` command that writes `{ id, name }` to `.bunny/database.json`. Subsequent `db` commands resolve the target without needing `BUNNY_DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
  - Database ID resolution order is now: explicit argument → `.bunny/database.json` → `BUNNY_DATABASE_URL` in `.env` → interactive prompt. The resolver also returns the database name when known, so commands like `db tokens create` can show `Database: <name> (<id>) (from ...)` without an extra API call.
  - `bunny db create` now offers to link the new database to the current directory, generate an auth token, and save credentials to `.env`. Three new flags make these phases non-interactive: `--link`/`--no-link`, `--token`/`--no-token`, `--save-env`/`--no-save-env`. In `--output json` mode, prompts are suppressed entirely — flags are the only way to opt in. The JSON output gains `linked`, `token`, and `saved_to_env` fields.
  - `bunny db delete` now removes `.bunny/database.json` automatically when it points at the deleted database, so subsequent commands don't try to resolve a dead ID.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- [#40](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/40) [`1b77eea`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/1b77eeae362f442c1a3f920d70456c0911b69294) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - fix `db studio` for table and column names containing spaces

  The studio API rejected any identifier that didn't match
  `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`, returning a 400 "Invalid table name" for
  tables or columns with spaces. Replaced the validation with safe
  double-quote identifier escaping so any SQLite-valid name works.

- [#42](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/pull/42) [`3cd013d`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/3cd013dc0b3cfad3d49e0327ee81d181b6b8720f) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - improve `db studio` error handling

  A single broken table used to cause cascading UI problems:

  - `/api/tables` would 500 if any one table's row count failed, locking
    users out of the sidebar entirely. The endpoint now isolates per-table
    errors and returns a `null` row count for just the broken table.
  - The client's `fetch` wrapper now surfaces the server's `error` body in
    the thrown message instead of a bare `API error: 500`.
  - `TableView` now shows an error screen with a Retry button when a table
    fails to load, instead of silently rendering an empty half-initialized
    view. Refresh failures keep stale data visible with an inline banner.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- [`72759e7`](https://github.com/BunnyWay/cli/commit/72759e772dc5ca2810e59eb6ba8d5703633de398) Thanks [@jamie-at-bunny](https://github.com/jamie-at-bunny)! - embed studio assets in compiled CLI binary

  The database studio UI was returning "Not Found" when launched from
  the compiled binary because the static files weren't embedded in
  the executable. Studio assets are now bundled via Bun's file
  embedding at compile time.
